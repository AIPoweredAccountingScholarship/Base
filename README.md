We use a large language model (LLM) to conduct empirical accounting research on the causal effect of securities regulation on voluntary disclosure. 

We start by using LLM to identify securities regulations both in the U.S. and the non-U.S. jurisdictions. We then use LLM to map each regulation to the channel on how a particular securities regulation may affect voluntary disclosure. These channels include litigation risk, corporate governance, proprietary costs, information asymmetry, protection of unsophisticated investors, equity issuance, and reputation risk. A securities regulation can affect voluntary disclosure through more than one channel and LLM writes a seperate academic paper for each securities regulation-voluntary disclosure channel combination. 

LLM generates 380 academic papers with significant results examining how mandatory securities regulations influence U.S. firms' voluntary disclosure practices.

The AI-generated papers can be found in the Manuscripts folders. There are 242 AI-generated papers for U.S. securities laws and 138 AI-generated papers for non-U.S. securities regulations. The papers were generated using Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Python.
