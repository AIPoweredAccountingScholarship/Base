# AI-Powered Accounting Scholarship

We use a large language model (LLM) to conduct empirical accounting research on voluntary disclosure. First, the LLM identifies securities laws in the U.S. and international jurisdictions. Second, the LLM maps each law to established theoretical frameworks including litigation risk, corporate governance, proprietary costs, information asymmetry, unsophisticated investors, equity issuance, and reputation risk. Finally, the LLM generates 380 academic papers examining how mandatory securities regulations, both in the U.S. and internationally, influence firms' voluntary disclosure practices.
