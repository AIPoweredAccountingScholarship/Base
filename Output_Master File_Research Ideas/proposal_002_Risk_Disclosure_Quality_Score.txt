Title:
The Volcker Rule and Bank Risk Disclosure Quality: Evidence from the Dodd-Frank Act Implementation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Research Question: What is the impact of Volcker Rule implementation on banks' risk disclosure practices and the informativeness of their risk-related financial statement disclosures?

Outcome Variable: Risk_Disclosure_Quality_Score

Research Question:
This study examines how the implementation of the Volcker Rule under the Dodd-Frank Act affected the quality and informativeness of risk-related disclosures in bank financial statements. The Volcker Rule's prohibition of proprietary trading by banks created significant operational and regulatory changes that likely influenced how banks communicate risk information to stakeholders. We hypothesize that banks subject to the Volcker Rule enhanced their risk disclosure quality following implementation, driven by increased regulatory scrutiny, litigation concerns, and the need to differentiate between prohibited proprietary trading and permitted market-making activities. This research question is important because it addresses how major regulatory changes affect corporate transparency and the informativeness of mandatory disclosures.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation:
Understanding the relationship between financial regulation and disclosure quality is crucial for accounting research because disclosures serve as the primary mechanism through which firms communicate with external stakeholders about their risk profiles and operational changes. The Volcker Rule represents one of the most significant regulatory changes affecting bank operations since the Glass-Steagall Act, making it essential to examine how such comprehensive reforms influence corporate reporting practices (Beatty et al., 2013). Furthermore, risk disclosures are particularly important for financial institutions given their role in capital allocation and systemic risk, and the quality of these disclosures directly affects market efficiency and investor protection (Hirtle, 2007). This research contributes to our understanding of how regulatory pressure shapes voluntary and mandatory disclosure decisions, with implications for standard setters and regulators designing future disclosure requirements.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical Framework and Existing Work:
Prior literature suggests competing theoretical predictions regarding the relationship between regulation and disclosure quality. Agency theory predicts that increased regulatory oversight reduces information asymmetry and encourages more transparent reporting to avoid regulatory penalties (Beatty et al., 2013). However, proprietary cost theory suggests that detailed risk disclosures may reveal competitive information, potentially leading firms to reduce disclosure quality when facing operational restrictions like those imposed by the Volcker Rule (Hirtle, 2007). The litigation risk channel provides another theoretical lens, as enhanced regulatory scrutiny following Dodd-Frank likely increased banks' exposure to legal challenges, potentially motivating more comprehensive risk disclosures as a defensive mechanism. These competing theories suggest that the net effect of Volcker Rule implementation on disclosure quality is ultimately an empirical question requiring careful identification and measurement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research Design:
We employ a difference-in-differences research design to examine the causal effect of Volcker Rule implementation on bank risk disclosure quality. Our regression specification is:

Risk_Disclosure_Quality_Score = β₀ + β₁Post_Volcker + β₂Treated_Bank + β₃(Post_Volcker × Treated_Bank) + β₄Bank_Size + β₅ROA + β₆Tier1_Capital_Ratio + β₇Trading_Revenue_Ratio + β₈Loan_Loss_Provisions + β₉Market_to_Book + Bank_FE + Quarter_FE + ε

The dependent variable, Risk_Disclosure_Quality_Score, is constructed using textual analysis of banks' 10-K and 10-Q filings obtained from SEC EDGAR database. We measure this composite score by: (1) extracting risk-related sections using keyword searches for terms like "risk factors," "market risk," "credit risk," and "operational risk"; (2) calculating total word count and number of specific risk factors disclosed; (3) identifying forward-looking risk statements using linguistic analysis; (4) extracting quantitative risk metrics including Value-at-Risk, stress test results, and trading exposure measures; and (5) measuring specificity through readability scores and granularity indices.

Our key independent variable, Post_Volcker, equals one for quarters after July 2012 when the Volcker Rule was finalized, and zero otherwise. Treated_Bank identifies banks subject to the Volcker Rule (those with total consolidated assets exceeding $50 billion or significant trading activities). We obtain bank financial data from Call Reports (FFIEC 031/041 forms) and market data from CRSP.

Control variables include Bank_Size (natural logarithm of total assets), ROA (net income divided by total assets), Tier1_Capital_Ratio (Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets), Trading_Revenue_Ratio (trading revenue divided by total revenue), Loan_Loss_Provisions (provision expense divided by total loans), and Market_to_Book ratio (market value of equity divided by book value). Our sample spans 2008-2016, providing sufficient pre- and post-implementation periods. We include bank and quarter fixed effects to control for time-invariant bank characteristics and common time trends, respectively. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level to account for serial correlation (Beatty et al., 2013; Hirtle, 2007).

Contribution:
This study makes several important contributions to the accounting and banking literature. First, we provide novel evidence on how comprehensive financial regulation affects the quality and informativeness of corporate disclosures, extending beyond traditional studies of individual disclosure requirements. Second, we develop and validate a comprehensive measure of risk disclosure quality specifically tailored to financial institutions, contributing to the growing literature on textual analysis in accounting research. Third, our findings inform regulators and standard setters about the unintended consequences of major regulatory reforms on corporate transparency and market communication. Finally, this research provides insights into how banks adapt their disclosure strategies in response to operational restrictions, with implications for understanding the broader effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on financial market transparency.
