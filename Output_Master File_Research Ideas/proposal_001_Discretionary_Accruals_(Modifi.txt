Title:
The Impact of Dodd-Frank Act on Earnings Management Practices among Systemically Important Financial Institutions: Evidence from Discretionary Accruals

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Research Question: How did the Dodd-Frank Act affect financial reporting quality and earnings management practices among systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)?

Outcome Variable: Discretionary Accruals (Modified Jones Model)

Research Question:
This study examines how the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act affected earnings management practices among systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Specifically, we investigate whether enhanced regulatory oversight, increased transparency requirements, and heightened systemic risk monitoring introduced by Dodd-Frank led to significant changes in discretionary accruals behavior among SIFIs compared to non-SIFI financial institutions. We hypothesize that SIFIs experienced a greater reduction in earnings management practices following Dodd-Frank implementation due to intensified regulatory scrutiny and reputational concerns. This question is particularly important given the systemic risk implications of earnings management at large financial institutions and the substantial regulatory resources devoted to monitoring these entities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation:
Understanding the effectiveness of Dodd-Frank in constraining earnings management among SIFIs is crucial for several reasons. First, earnings management at systemically important institutions poses significant risks to financial stability, as demonstrated during the 2008 financial crisis when aggressive accounting practices masked underlying risks (Cohen et al., 2008). Second, the substantial costs associated with Dodd-Frank implementation require empirical validation of its effectiveness in improving financial reporting quality. Third, SIFIs' earnings management practices have broader economic implications due to their interconnectedness and potential for systemic contagion (Beatty & Liao, 2014). This research provides critical evidence on whether enhanced regulatory oversight translates into measurable improvements in financial reporting integrity among the most systemically important institutions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical Framework and Existing Work:
Prior literature provides competing theoretical predictions regarding regulation's impact on earnings management. Agency theory suggests that increased regulatory oversight should reduce managerial opportunism and improve reporting quality (Healy & Wahlen, 1999). However, regulatory capture theory and the flexibility hypothesis argue that sophisticated institutions may find alternative methods to manage earnings under new regulatory regimes. Studies examining post-SOX earnings management show mixed results, with some finding reduced accruals manipulation but increased real activities manipulation (Cohen et al., 2008). The financial institutions literature specifically highlights the unique regulatory environment and incentive structures that may lead to different responses compared to non-financial firms (Beatty & Liao, 2014). Given SIFIs' heightened regulatory scrutiny under Dodd-Frank, we expect the regulatory oversight effect to dominate, leading to reduced discretionary accruals.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research Design:
We employ a difference-in-differences research design to examine the causal impact of Dodd-Frank on earnings management practices. Our regression specification is:

Discretionary_Accruals = β₀ + β₁SIFI + β₂Post_Dodd_Frank + β₃(SIFI × Post_Dodd_Frank) + β₄Size + β₅ROA + β₆Leverage + β₇Book_to_Market + β₈Loan_Loss_Provisions + β₉Tier1_Capital_Ratio + β₁₀GDP_Growth + β₁₁Interest_Rate_Environment + Year_FE + Bank_FE + ε

The dependent variable, Discretionary_Accruals, is measured using the Modified Jones model specifically adapted for financial institutions. We calculate total accruals as the difference between net income and operating cash flows from Compustat. We then estimate the following first-stage regression by year and two-digit SIC code: Total_Accruals/Assets = α₀ + α₁(1/Assets) + α₂(ΔRevenues - ΔReceivables)/Assets + α₃PPE/Assets + α₄Loan_Loss_Provisions/Assets + error. Discretionary accruals are the residuals from this regression, obtained from Compustat data items including net income (NI), operating cash flows (OANCF), total assets (AT), revenues (REVT), receivables (RECT), and property, plant, and equipment (PPENT).

Our key independent variable, SIFI, is a binary indicator equal to one for banks designated as systemically important under Dodd-Frank's enhanced supervision framework. We identify SIFIs using Federal Reserve Board announcements and regulatory filings, cross-referenced with bank holding company data from the Federal Reserve's National Information Center database. Post_Dodd_Frank equals one for years 2011-2018, zero for 2006-2010.

Control variables include: Size (natural logarithm of total assets from AT), ROA (net income divided by average total assets, calculated as NI/AT), Leverage (total liabilities divided by total assets, calculated as LT/AT), Book_to_Market (book value of equity divided by market value, using CSHO and PRCC_F from Compustat), Loan_Loss_Provisions (provision for loan losses scaled by total assets), Tier1_Capital_Ratio (from regulatory filings via the Federal Reserve's Bank Holding Company database), GDP_Growth (quarterly GDP growth from Federal Reserve Economic Data), and Interest_Rate_Environment (10-year Treasury rate from FRED database).

We include bank and year fixed effects to control for time-invariant bank characteristics and common time trends. Standard errors are clustered at the bank level to account for serial correlation. Our sample spans 2006-2018, encompassing both pre- and post-Dodd-Frank periods, using data from Compustat, CRSP, and Federal Reserve regulatory databases (Cohen et al., 2008; Beatty & Liao, 2014).

Contribution:
This study makes several important contributions to the accounting and banking literature. First, we provide the first comprehensive examination of Dodd-Frank's impact on earnings management specifically among SIFIs, filling a critical gap in understanding regulatory effectiveness. Second, we contribute to the broader literature on regulation and financial reporting quality by examining a unique regulatory setting with differential treatment intensity. Third, our findings inform policymakers about the effectiveness of enhanced supervision in constraining opportunistic reporting behavior among systemically important institutions. Finally, we extend the earnings management literature by examining how regulatory designation itself affects reporting incentives in the banking sector.
