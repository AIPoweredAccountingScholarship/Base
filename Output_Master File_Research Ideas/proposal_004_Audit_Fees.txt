Title:
Enhanced Corporate Governance Requirements Under Dodd-Frank: Evidence on Audit Fees, Quality, and Auditor Selection

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Research Question: What are the effects of enhanced corporate governance requirements under Dodd-Frank on audit fees, audit quality, and auditor selection decisions?

Outcome Variable: Audit Fees

Research Question:
This study examines how the enhanced corporate governance requirements introduced by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act affected audit fees, audit quality, and auditor selection decisions among financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act implemented comprehensive governance reforms including enhanced risk management oversight, executive compensation restrictions, and increased board independence requirements. We hypothesize that these enhanced governance requirements increased the complexity and scope of audit procedures, leading to higher audit fees. Additionally, we predict that stronger governance mechanisms improved audit quality through better auditor-client relationships and reduced management override risks, while potentially influencing firms' preferences toward larger, more specialized audit firms capable of handling the increased regulatory complexity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Motivation:
Understanding the audit market implications of Dodd-Frank's corporate governance reforms is crucial for several reasons. First, audit fees represent a significant cost to financial institutions, and regulatory changes that systematically increase these costs have important economic implications for the banking sector and capital allocation efficiency (Krishnan et al., 2008). Second, the relationship between corporate governance strength and audit quality has direct implications for financial reporting reliability and investor protection, which are central objectives of the Dodd-Frank legislation (Defond & Zhang, 2014). Finally, examining how regulatory governance requirements influence auditor selection decisions provides insights into audit market dynamics and the role of auditor specialization in addressing regulatory complexity, contributing to our understanding of audit market structure and competition (Francis et al., 2013).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Theoretical Framework and Existing Work:
Prior literature provides mixed theoretical predictions regarding the relationship between corporate governance strength and audit fees. Agency theory suggests that stronger governance mechanisms may reduce audit risk and consequently audit fees, as better-governed firms pose lower risks to auditors (Carcello et al., 2002). However, complementary theories argue that enhanced governance requirements may increase audit complexity and scope, leading to higher fees as auditors must perform additional procedures to assess and test the effectiveness of governance mechanisms (Abbott et al., 2003). The regulatory compliance literature further suggests that new governance requirements create additional audit work related to compliance testing and documentation, potentially increasing audit fees regardless of the underlying governance quality improvements. These competing theoretical perspectives create an empirical question regarding the net effect of Dodd-Frank's governance requirements on audit market outcomes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research Design:
We employ a difference-in-differences research design comparing financial institutions subject to Dodd-Frank governance requirements (treatment group) with non-financial firms (control group) over the period 2008-2014. Our main regression specification is:

Ln(Audit_Fees) = β₀ + β₁(Financial_Firm × Post_Dodd_Frank) + β₂Financial_Firm + β₃Post_Dodd_Frank + β₄Ln(Total_Assets) + β₅Leverage + β₆ROA + β₇Loss + β₈Big4_Auditor + β₉Audit_Opinion + β₀Going_Concern + β₁₁Restatement + β₁₂Internal_Control_Weakness + β₁₃Segments + β₁₄Foreign_Operations + Industry_FE + Year_FE + ε

The dependent variable, Ln(Audit_Fees), is the natural logarithm of total audit fees paid to external auditors, obtained from Audit Analytics database using the 'audfees' field. We calculate this by extracting annual audit fees from proxy statements (DEF 14A filings) and taking the natural logarithm to address skewness in the fee distribution.

Our key independent variable, Financial_Firm × Post_Dodd_Frank, is an interaction term where Financial_Firm equals one for firms with SIC codes 6000-6999 (financial institutions) and zero otherwise, identified using Compustat's 'sich' field. Post_Dodd_Frank equals one for years 2011-2014 (post-implementation) and zero for 2008-2010 (pre-implementation period).

Control variables include: Ln(Total_Assets) from Compustat's 'at' field; Leverage calculated as total debt divided by total assets using 'dltt' plus 'dlc' divided by 'at'; ROA measured as net income ('ni') divided by total assets ('at'); Loss indicator equal to one if net income is negative; Big4_Auditor indicator from Audit Analytics 'big4' field; Audit_Opinion from Audit Analytics 'op_opinion' field; Going_Concern from 'gc_opinion' field; Restatement indicator from Audit Analytics restatement database; Internal_Control_Weakness from SOX 404 disclosures in Audit Analytics; Segments count from Compustat segments database; and Foreign_Operations indicator based on geographic segment data.

We include industry fixed effects using Fama-French 48 industry classifications and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the firm level to account for serial correlation. Data sources include Audit Analytics for audit fee and auditor data, Compustat for financial statement information, and CRSP for stock return data, following established methodologies in audit fee research (Hay et al., 2006; Simunic, 1980).

Contribution:
This study contributes to the audit literature by providing the first comprehensive examination of how major financial regulation affects audit market outcomes through corporate governance channels. We extend prior work on regulatory effects on audit fees by identifying the specific mechanism through which Dodd-Frank influenced audit markets, distinguishing governance-related effects from other regulatory impacts. Additionally, we contribute to the corporate governance literature by documenting the audit market consequences of regulatory governance reforms, providing evidence on whether mandated governance improvements generate net benefits when considering implementation costs. Our findings have important policy implications for regulators designing future governance requirements and for audit standard setters considering the audit implications of regulatory changes.
